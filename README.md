# PDFly-Chat
Our project aims to revolutionize document interaction through the development
of a LangChain-powered PDF chatbot. By integrating advanced generative AI
and contextual understanding, users can engage in natural language conversations to extract, summarize, and interact with PDF content effortlessly. Our
chatbot will provide seamless navigation, enabling users to ask questions, retrieve key information, and annotate documents with ease. Through overcoming
the limitations of traditional LLMs, we aim to empower users across various
domains to harness the full potential of conversational AI within the realm of
PDF documents
